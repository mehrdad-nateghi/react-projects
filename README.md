# React Projects 

When I should learn a new technology I create a repository immediately and build many projects.

I think this is a good habit. Don't you think so?
If your answer is YES!
If you are going to learn React then create a repository and build many projects from simple to advance.

Don't worry about what other people say about your code.
Professional programmers never judge your code as someone who is still learning, but collaborate on your projects to speed up your learning.

I know. A professional programmer knows. You should also know that we learn by making.
